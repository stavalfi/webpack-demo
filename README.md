Run the project:
---

```javascript
git clone https://github.com/stavalfi/webpack-demo.git
cd webpack-demo
git checkout typescript-react
npm install
npm start
```

If you already have this project, then optn the terminal in the project folder and then:

```javascript
git fetch
git checkout typescript-react
git merge origin/typescript-react
npm install
npm start 
```

_Note:_ Start develope while the command `npm start ` is running inthe background. 

What you can/can't modify/add/remove in the `src` folder:
* modify `main.css` or remove it and create your own css files. You can create multiple css files located anywhere under `src` folder.
* You can modify `output-index-tamplate.html` but after each modification you need to manually refresh the broswer. This is not recommanded because this project is using react to change the `DOM`.
* Don't change `index.tsx`.
* You can and should modify/replace `Hello.tsx`. If you want to only change the DOM in your app, your should only write inside:
  `<div id="your-dom">do what you want here </div>`
* You are free to add more classes and components anywhere under src folder. It is recommanded to do in under specific folder like components if you are using React. Each `js`/`ts` file should be names as `XXX.tsx`.
