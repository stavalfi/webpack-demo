Additional notes:
1. hash is calculated for a build, chunkhash is calculated for chunk (entry file), contenthash
    is special hash generated in ExtractTextPlugin and is calculated by extracted content, not by
    whole chunk content. See this article https://medium.com/@okonetchnikov/long-term-caching-of-static-assets-with-webpack-1ecb139adb95#.f9aon6s3b
